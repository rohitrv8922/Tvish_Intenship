# Face Emotion Recognition
Facial Emotion recognition is a way of identifying the current emotional state of an
individual to observer.

Facial expressions can display personal emotions and indicate an individual's intentions
within
a social situation.
Facial expressions and other gestures convey nonverbal communication cues that play an
important role in interpersonal relations. Example:- A simple smile can indicate our
approval of a message, while a scowl might signal displeasure or disagreement. These
cues complement speech by helping the listener to interpret the intended meaning of
spoken words. Therefore, facial expression recognition extracts and analyzes
information from an image or video feed, it is able to deliver unfiltered, unbiased
emotional responses as data.

PyCharm - i have run my test.py file in the pyCharm for testing my project accuracy and i found that it was  70% accurate in detecting the emotions of a face.
Matplotlib
pandas
Numpy

I have mentioned all the novelty of the project in my Face_Emotion_Assignmnent.pynb colab file  and aslo mention some limitations of my project and also providing some suggestion to enhancing the project to make the model more accurate and precise.
